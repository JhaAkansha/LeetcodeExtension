# LeetcodeExtension
A web browser extension to push your Leetcode solution to GitHub in just one click.

Add your repository URL and Personal Acess Token to the extension to allow pushing to this repo on GitHub.
On successful submission of your solution in leetcode, the "Push to GitHub" button activates. The topic gets added as a new folder, if it doesn't already exists, and the Problem name is extracted to be the title. The problem statement is added as the comment in your solution file. This code also extracts the programming language used in your solution and maps it to an extension used to create your solution file. This solution file is then pushed in your repository. Now you can maintain, both your LeetCode and GitHub streak more conveniently!
